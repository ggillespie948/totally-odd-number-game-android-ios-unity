Thanks for your purchase!

This package contains 1 Skybox. It's the 5th of 10 color themes(all available separatedly, as well as a pack) of the "Blueprint / Schematic - Skybox 02" series.

The skyboxes is perfectly seamless. It wraps a background around the viewer and resembles a blueprint or schematic, a pseudo technical drawing board if you want. This is perfect, if you want to present assets/units in your game or application, such as on a unit customization screen, or a tech screen, etc. 

The texture is provided in .psd format for 3 reasons: 
1. it's lossless 
2. you can change or remove labels/typographic elements easily, as they are kept on seperated layers.
3. You can export to any format you desire. Should you need help with this, get in touch.

The textures are provivided in cubemap(row) format for ease of use. Each side of the cubemap is 2k in resolution. 

To select a skybox in Unity, go to Window -> Lighting and select one of the Blueprintxx_xx materials at the top under "Environment Lighting > Skybox". Make sure you have the skybox toggle in your scene view turned on.

Should you need a custom color variation, that is beyond what you can do with the provided .psd files, please get in touch with support@machin3.io so we can create a unique variation in exchange for a small fee.

Enjoy and good luck with your projects!
